# Contributing / Workflow Guide

Branch strategy
- main — stable, always deployable.
- develop (optional) — integration branch.
- feature/<short-description> — feature branches for each task/issue.
- fix/<issue-number>-short — bugfix branches.

General workflow
1. Create an issue describing the task (assign owner and add labels).
2. Create a branch from main (or develop): git checkout -b feature/issue-123-navbar
3. Implement changes, commit frequently with meaningful messages.
   - Commit format suggestion: feat(navbar): add responsive menu
4. Push branch and open a Pull Request to main (or develop).
5. Request at least one reviewer from your team.
6. Address review comments; when approved, merge via Squash or Merge (follow project policy).

Git tips
- git checkout -b feature/your-feature
- git add -A; git commit -m "short, meaningful message"
- git push --set-upstream origin feature/your-feature

Code review expectations
- Focus on clarity, correctness, and accessibility.
- Leave constructive comments and approve once issues are resolved.

Testing & CI
- Add tests where applicable (unit or integration).
- Fix linter warnings before requesting merge.

Deployment
- If using GitHub Pages, ensure build step writes to the gh-pages branch or main as configured.
